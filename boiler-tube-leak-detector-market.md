<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Tube Leak Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Airborne Sensor</li><li>Structure Borne Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Boiler Tube Leak Detector Market includes two types of sensors used for detecting leaks in boiler tubes: airborne sensors and structure-borne sensors. Airborne sensors are designed to detect leaks in the surrounding air by analyzing the changes in gas concentrations or particles caused by the leaking fluid. On the other hand, structure-borne sensors are installed directly on the boiler tubes to detect vibrations or changes in the tube's physical properties that indicate a leak. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of boiler systems.</p></p>
