<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multilayer Inductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Mount Technology</li><li>Through Hole Technology</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Multilayer Inductor Market includes two main types: Surface Mount Technology (SMT) and Through Hole Technology. SMT is a modern method where electronic components are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB). SMT provides higher component density, increased production speed, and cost efficiency. Through Hole Technology, on the other hand, involves components with leads that are inserted into holes in the PCB and soldered in place. Though less common today, Through Hole Technology is still used in certain applications that require durability and high reliability.</p></p>
