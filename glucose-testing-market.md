<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Minimal Invasive Testing</li><li>Non-invasive Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glucose testing market is divided into two types: minimal invasive testing and non-invasive testing. Minimal invasive testing involves obtaining blood samples through pricking the skin, typically using a lancet, and measuring glucose levels using a glucose meter. Non-invasive testing, on the other hand, does not require blood samples and instead utilizes technologies like continuous glucose monitoring systems or transdermal patches to measure glucose levels through the skin. Both types of testing are commonly used for monitoring blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
