<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary pneumatic cylinder market includes two main types: double acting and single acting cylinders. Double acting cylinders use air pressure to extend and retract the piston, offering control in both directions. These cylinders are commonly used in applications that require precise movement, such as robotics. On the other hand, single acting cylinders use air pressure to extend the piston, but rely on a spring to retract it. They are often used in simpler applications, where precise control in both directions is not necessary.</p></p>
