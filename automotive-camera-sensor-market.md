<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Camera Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)</li><li>Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Camera Sensor market consists of two main types: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) and Charge-Coupled Device (CCD). CMOS sensors are widely used in automotive cameras due to their low power consumption, high integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. They convert light into electrical signals and offer faster processing speed. On the other hand, CCD sensors use a complex structure to collect and transfer electrical charges, providing high-quality images with low noise levels. However, they tend to consume more power and are less cost-effective compared to CMOS sensors.</p></p>
