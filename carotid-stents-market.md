<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expandable Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carotid stents are medical devices used to treat carotid artery disease, a condition where the arteries in the neck become narrowed or blocked. Balloon expandable stents are a type of carotid stent that is inserted into the artery and then expanded using a balloon to keep the artery open. Self-expanding stents, on the other hand, are designed to expand on their own and do not require a balloon. Both types of stents are effective in treating carotid artery disease and can improve blood flow to the brain.</p></p>
