<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Etchants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Etching Agent</li><li>Dry Etching Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Semiconductor Etchants Market comprises two types of etching agents: wet etching agents and dry etching agents. Wet etching agents are liquids or chemical solutions that remove selected materials from the surface of semiconductors through a chemical reaction. They are commonly used because they are cost-effective and can achieve high selectivity. On the other hand, dry etching agents are gases or plasmas that remove materials through physical processes, such as sputtering or reactive ion etching. Dry etching provides more precise and controlled etching processes but can be more expensive.</p></p>
