<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Long Radar System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW Radars</li><li>Pulsed Radars</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CW (Continuous Wave) radars and pulsed radars are two types of long radar systems used in various applications. </p><p>CW radars emit continuous radio frequency signals and receive the reflected signals to measure the distance and velocity of targets. They provide a continuous stream of information but lack the ability to accurately determine the location of targets.</p><p>Pulsed radars, on the other hand, emit short bursts of radio frequency signals followed by a listening period. They measure the time taken for the signal to return and analyze this data to determine the range, velocity, and direction of targets. Pulsed radars offer higher accuracy and are commonly used in military, aviation, and weather monitoring systems.</p></p>
