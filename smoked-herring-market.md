<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>There are two main types of smoked herring markets: hot-smoke and cold-smoke. In the hot-smoke market, herring is exposed to high temperatures, usually over an open flame, causing the fish to cook partially while also getting infused with smoky flavors. This method results in a flaky texture and a more intense smoky taste. On the other hand, the cold-smoke market involves smoking herring in a controlled environment with lower temperatures. This method preserves the fish by infusing it with a milder smoky flavor, while maintaining its raw texture.</p></p>
