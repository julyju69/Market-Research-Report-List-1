<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fiber Veil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Laid Process</li><li>Dry-Laid Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glass fiber veil market can be categorized into two types based on the manufacturing process: wet-laid process and dry-laid process. In the wet-laid process, glass fibers are dispersed in water and then formed into a mat using a papermaking technique. This method allows for better fiber orientation and uniformity. On the other hand, the dry-laid process involves randomly distributing glass fibers onto a moving belt, which is then bonded together using heat or adhesive. This technique is cost-effective but may result in less uniformity.</p></p>
