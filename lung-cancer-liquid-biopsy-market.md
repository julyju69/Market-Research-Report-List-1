<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung Cancer Liquid Biopsy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exosomes and RNA</li><li>CTCs and ctDNA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lung Cancer Liquid Biopsy Market includes two key types: exosomes and RNA, and CTCs and ctDNA. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released by cells that contain genetic information like RNA, making them useful for detecting lung cancer-related mutations. On the other hand, CTCs (circulating tumor cells) and ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) are fragments shed by tumors into the bloodstream, providing insights into tumor progression and treatment response. These non-invasive liquid biopsies offer promising avenues for diagnosing and monitoring lung cancer, facilitating personalized treatment decisions.</p></p>
