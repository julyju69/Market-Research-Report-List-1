<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infiltration Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Conductive Roller Head</li><li>Conductive Roller Head</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infiltration pumps are medical devices used for effectively delivering fluids or medications into the body. There are two main types of infiltration pumps in the market, namely non-conductive roller head and conductive roller head pumps. Non-conductive roller head pumps are designed to prevent electrical conductance, reducing the risk of electric shock during operation. On the other hand, conductive roller head pumps are specifically built to allow electrical conductance, typically used in surgical procedures where electrical stimulation or monitoring is required. Both types are crucial in delivering accurate and safe fluid administration to patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Infiltration Pumps Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tumescent Liposuction</li><li>Lipofilling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infiltration pumps are used in various medical procedures, including tumescent liposuction and lipofilling. Tumescent liposuction involves injecting a large volume of a dilute solution into the fatty tissues to facilitate the removal of excess fat through suction. Infiltration pumps are used to deliver the solution accurately and at controlled pressures. Similarly, in lipofilling, the pumps are used to inject a patient's own fat into areas that need volume enhancement, such as the face or breasts. These pumps ensure precise delivery and improve the overall efficiency of the procedures.</p></p>
