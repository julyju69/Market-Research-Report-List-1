<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Satellite Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Satellite Sensor</li><li>Passive Satellite Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The satellite sensor market can be categorized into two major types: active satellite sensors and passive satellite sensors. Active satellite sensors emit their own signal or energy source, such as a radar or lidar, which is then reflected back to the sensor to measure various characteristics of the target. On the other hand, passive satellite sensors rely on the natural energy emitted or reflected by the target, such as sunlight or thermal radiation, to capture and measure the desired data. These sensors play a crucial role in collecting information for various applications, including weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</p></p>
