<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Master Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Push-type</li><li>Pull-type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft master cylinders are an integral part of an aircraft's hydraulic brake system. There are two main types of master cylinders in the market: push-type and pull-type. </p><p>Push-type master cylinders work by pushing the piston into the cylinder, which in turn applies pressure on the hydraulic fluid to activate the brakes. Pull-type master cylinders, on the other hand, operate by pulling the piston, creating a vacuum that activates the brakes. </p><p>Both types play a crucial role in converting the mechanical force from the pilot's input into hydraulic pressure to control the aircraft's braking system.</p></p>
