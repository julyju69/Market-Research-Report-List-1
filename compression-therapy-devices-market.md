<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compression Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Compression Therapy</li><li>Dynamic Compression Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression therapy devices are used to improve blood flow and reduce swelling in the limbs. Static compression therapy involves applying a constant level of pressure to the affected area using compression stockings or bandages. This type of therapy is effective for managing chronic conditions such as lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Dynamic compression therapy, on the other hand, utilizes intermittent pneumatic compression devices to deliver pulsating pressure to the affected area, mimicking the natural muscle pump function. This therapy is beneficial for preventing deep vein thrombosis and improving circulation in individuals who are immobilized or have limited mobility.</p></p>
