<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure mode neonatal ventilators are commonly used in the medical field for respiratory support in newborns. There are two main types of ventilators in the market - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators deliver pressurized air directly into the baby's lungs through an endotracheal tube, while non-invasive ventilators provide respiratory support through a mask or nasal prongs. Both types of ventilators help maintain proper oxygen levels in the blood and support the baby's respiratory function, but they differ in how the air is delivered to the lungs.</p></p>
