<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deflectometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Falling Weight Deflectometer</li><li>Light Weight Deflectometer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Deflectometer is a device used to measure the deflection or deformation of a surface, typically a road or pavement. There are two main types of Deflectometer markets - Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD). FWD uses a heavy weight dropped onto the surface to measure deflection, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, LWD is smaller and portable, making it ideal for quick and simple deflection measurements. Both types of Deflectometers serve the purpose of evaluating the structural integrity and performance of roads and pavements.</p></p>
