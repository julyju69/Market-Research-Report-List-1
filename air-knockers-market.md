<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Knockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuously Impacting Type</li><li>Indirect Impacting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air knockers are devices used for dislodging clogs or particulate matter that can affect industrial production processes. There are two market types for air knockers: continuously impacting type and indirect impacting type. Continuously impacting type air knockers work by vibrating continuously, applying constant force to dislodge material. On the other hand, indirect impacting type air knockers generate air pulses that indirectly impact the clogged material, causing it to dislodge. Both types serve the same purpose of improving efficiency and preventing blockages but differ in the method of generating force to dislodge the unwanted material.</p></p>
