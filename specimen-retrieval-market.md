<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval market includes detachable and non-detachable types. Detachable retrieval devices are designed to gather tissue samples or foreign bodies and can be disconnected from the delivery system for removal. These devices offer easy retrieval and reduced risk of damage to specimens during removal. On the other hand, non-detachable retrieval devices are permanently attached to the delivery system and require additional tools for specimen extraction. Although non-detachable devices may provide stability during procedures, they may also increase the risk of specimen damage during extraction.</p></p>
